# Etch-a-Sketch
Work for Odin project

In this project, Iâ€™ll be creating a pretty neat toy to flex my DOM manipulation skills. I am going to build a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch. The main purporse is to  learn how to find solutions and how to divide big prblems in small elements. The Project is a little beyond my knowledge, but the point is to make it real using all possible help.
